# Project Kraken
The Kenmore Heritage Society Inc. (501c3) has a mission to educate the general public on the rich and diverse culture of the Northshore region and greater Sammamish Slough. In the spirit of this endeavor, and to literally put humble **Kenmore by the Lake** on the map of public consciousness, we have geotagged entries of the yearly Fun Photo Contest for you.

## Contributions
Many parties have come together to provide this resource. Most importantly the photographers who generously contribute use of their images for explicitly non-commercial use. Kenmore Heritage Society Inc. in coordination with the generosity of Kenmore Camera and with funding from 4Culture organize the ongoing contest as part of our vision to encapsulate the general public's human perspective with themes that evoke positive human emotions... perhaps even a laugh or two. Many local business's have contributed prizes and awards for participants with what by now is seemingly a traditional grand prize, a flight for two with Kenmore Air. One of our winners, Geoff Vlcek has a close rendition of his award winning work hanging in the City's brand new "hanger" building, in Kenmore's Town Square. The City of Kenmore above all has embraced our good works and incorporated them into the fabric of the Northshore with beauty and flair. Thank you to our photographers most importantly for trusting society with GPS Data left unscrubbed from your images so they can be displayed here.

## Goals
- Educate the Public on the Northshore's Cultural Resources
- Create and Maintain an archive of Open Source Images to share for non-commercial purposes
- Promote a positive image of Kenmore and the Northshore
- Utilize images to fulfill 4Culture Grant Process
- Provide theme based marketing material to the City of Kenmore and 4Culture promoting Kenmore
- Provide ready access of images on an as needed basis in return for support with our mission
- Automate contest submission process to reduce human error

## Methodology
Being a non-profit, operating with limited to no budget, and reliant entirely on unpaid volunteers, we must abide certain economic realities with respect to open source software and services provided for free. Google should make the contributors list given google drive is what we use for archiving almost exclusively. Images from the contest are downloaded as attachments from email directly to a google drive folder created within the khsArchives > Photo Archive Collection > 2017.1.5 Fun Photo Contest folder for that specific year like here... [2017.1.5 Fun Photo Contest](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_UrNlZET5SSY000NG4zMmUtQTQ?usp=sharing)
Further, starting in 2017, we have begun using google photos for distributing albums containing our Grand Prize and Category winners along with albums of all photos categorically. This process is not currently automated and that remains a long term goal. Input error being the primary issue. Having an automated input process allowing users to input their own personal data might work ideal.
